# simple-backend

This is an abstraction level added on top of the fastAPI framework which is capable of programmatically adding and removing endpoints

There are still pending tasks which needs to be solved in order for it to be fully deployable

The goal is to integrate it with mysql which will be setted up along with backend and frontend from docker-compose so user can easily run it on his local machine
